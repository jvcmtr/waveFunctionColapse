# waveFunctionColapse
This is a realy simple and uneficient implementation of the wave function colapse algorithm with C# and some ascii characters. have been some time since i did something with C#, this implementation is a doodle i made in class to remember the sintax etc... .

There is DIMENTIONS and a TILESET variables that you can fidle with. You can also uncomment the Infinite loop region to 
make it keep generating indefinately.

there is no help command on the CLI. it just have the following commands:<ul>
<li> exit    » to exit the program;     </li>
<li> clear   » to clear the terminal;   </li>
<li> width   » you will be prompted to set a new width;    </li>
<li> heigth  » you will be prompted to set a new height;   </li>
<li> 10    » Type a number X and it will loop until it completes X images; </li>
<li> » Type 'blank' to just generate a new image;    </li>
